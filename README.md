# TimeSpare

A light website that suggests small activities to do to pass time in a useful way. Uses basic HTML, CSS, JS. https://atishayjain708.github.io/Timeâ€¦

## More about the  website

This website was created in a hackathon as one of my very first projects in Web Development. It is based on the simple idea of helping people utilize and save small bits of time here and there - walking back to your hostel from the cafeteria, waiting for laundry to finish, waiting for a lecture to start etc. that is otherwise wasted scrolling through social media. The website has guides for things you can learn in 5 minutes to those that'll take you 15 minutes to an hour. It's still an unfinished product though. Feel free to explore and give suggestions :)
